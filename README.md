# Face-Emotion-Recognition-Deep-Learning-Project
I have done this project as a part of our curriculam in Almabetter.

In this Project, I will:
* Develop a facial expression recognition model.  
* Build and train a convolutional neural network (CNN).  
* Deploy the trained model to a web interface with Flask.  
* Apply the model to real-time video streams and image data.

# Introduction:-
Face emotion recognition is a very good technology that we can use in real time for many benefits such as--
* We can use face emotion recognition to understand the expression of a customer after seeing any product or service.
* With the help of this project, We can understand weither the customer liked our product in restaurent or office.
* We can use face emotion recognition technology in school, College or in University to understand the facial expression of the students to understand weither they are understanding the lessons or not.

We can use it at so many other places as well.
