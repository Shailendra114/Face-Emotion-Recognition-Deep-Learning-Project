# Face-Emotion-Recognition-Deep-Learning-Project
I have done this project as a part of our curriculam in Almabetter.

In this Project, I will:
* Develop a facial expression recognition model.  
* Build and train a convolutional neural network (CNN).  
* Deploy the trained model to a web interface with Flask.  
* Apply the model to real-time video streams and image data.
